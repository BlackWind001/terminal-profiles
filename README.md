This repository will contain all of the terminal profiles
I have created for myself or have gotten from the internet.

I use the GNOME terminal and OhMyZsh.
Each terminal profile file will be mapped to its relevant
OhMyZsh theme in the PROFILE_TO_ZSH_THEME_MAP.json file.

You can load a terminal profile by first downloading the
specific file and then using the `dconf load` command to
add the profile to your GNOME terminal.

Reference: https://www.ubuntumint.com/export-import-gnome-terminal-profile/

To apply an OhMyZsh theme, just change the value of
ZSH_THEME environment variable.
